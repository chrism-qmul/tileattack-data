Sammy was seven years old. He loved to read, so his mother took him to the library. She told him to choose some books. While Sammy was looking at the books, his mother looked at the CDs. She loved to listen to music. Sammy chose ten books and the library said he could borrow them for one month. His mother chose three CDs but she could only borrow them for seven days. Sammy s books were free but his mother had to pay $2 for each CD. When they got home
Sammy read his books and his mother listened to her music!
